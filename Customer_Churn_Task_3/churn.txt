Customer Churn Prediction Model
Created By: SUVAM JANA
Overview
This repository contains a Customer Churn Prediction model that utilizes machine learning techniques(Logistic Regression) to forecast customer churn for a bank.
Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon of customers discontinuing their relationship with a company. 
Predicting customer churn can help businesses take proactive measures to retain valuable customers and improve overall customer satisfaction.

The model presented here is designed to analyze historical customer data and identify patterns that indicate potential churn. It employs a supervised learning approach, where the model is trained on labeled data (exited customers vs not exited customers) to learn the underlying patterns and relationships.

How to run:
1. Import all the files in the directory to local folder
2. Open powershell (or cmd prompt) window in that folder and run the command: 'streamlit run app.py'

The prompt will open a browser page where users can input relevant data to hit the predict button to see whether the customer will stay with the bank or leave.

Learning Algorithm used: Logistic Regression
Libraries used: 1. scikit-learn (for machine learning model training)
                2. numpy (for performing operation on number arrays)
                3. pandas (for creating and manipulating dataframes)
                4. streamlit (for creating and hosting the web app for the model, ready to be deployed!!!!)
