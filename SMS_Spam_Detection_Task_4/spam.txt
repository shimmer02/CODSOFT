SMS Spam Detection Model
Created by: SUVAM JANA

Overview:
Welcome to the SMS Spam Detection Model repository! 
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to identify and classify SMS messages as either spam or legitimate (ham). 
Unwanted spam messages can lead to user frustration and privacy concerns. 
This model aims to enhance user experience by filtering out such messages.
TF-IDF text vectorizer is also used for converting the text messages into float scores so that the messages can be fed to the model.

How to run:
1. Import all the files in the directory to local folder
2. Open powershell (or cmd prompt) window in that folder and run the command: 'streamlit run app.py'

The prompt will open a browser page where users can input a particular SMS message to check whether it is a spam or legitimate message(ham).

Learning Algorithm used: Logistic Regression
Libraries used: 1. scikit-learn (for machine learning model training)
                2. numpy (for performing operation on number arrays)
                3. pandas (for creating and manipulating dataframes)
                4. streamlit (for creating and hosting the web app for the model, ready to be deployed!!!!)
