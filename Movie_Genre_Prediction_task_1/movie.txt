Movie Genre Prediction Model
Created by: SUVAM JANA

Overview:
Welcome to the Movie Genre Prediction Model repository! 
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to identify and classify movie descriptions in certain genre categories. 
This can help viewers to get an idea of what they are about to watch from just a brief synopsis in case the genre is not given for the movie. 
This model aims to enhance user experience by letting them know more about the movie they want to watch.
TF-IDF text vectorizer is also used for converting the descriptions into float scores so that they can be fed to the model.

How to run:
1. Import all the files in the directory to local folder
2. Open powershell (or cmd prompt) window in that folder and run the command: 'streamlit run app.py'

The prompt will open a browser page where users can input a movie name, release date and a brief description to check what genre it belongs to.

Learning Algorithm used: Logistic Regression using One vs all method
Libraries used: 1. scikit-learn (for machine learning model training)
                2. numpy (for performing operation on number arrays)
                3. pandas (for creating and manipulating dataframes)
                4. streamlit (for creating and hosting the web app for the model, ready to be deployed!!!!)
